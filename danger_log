Need to limit the input when register and login (sql injection, etc)

Input from the user should always be limited.

Users should not be able to see all the ride info by simply typing the url.

User may share the ride twice if they double click on hyperlink

Sharer should not able to change ride information

Special info should be free text instead of build-in choices.
