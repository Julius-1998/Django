Need to limit the input when register and login (sql injection, etc)
    Check the information user input when login and register

Input from the user should always be limited.
    Limit the length and type of data when user input

Users should not be able to see all the ride info by simply typing the url.
    Modify the content of html by permission check

User may share the ride twice if they double click on hyperlink
    Disable the button when it's clicked

Sharer should not able to change ride information

Special info should be free text instead of build-in choices.
